Man pages: cherokee-admin-launcher
----------------------------------

This is a launcher for the administration user interface,
link:other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin]. It will check
for port availability, launch `cherokee-admin`, and automatically open
a web browser to access it.  Since it is a wrapper, it accepts exactly
the same parameters, but provides several extra features that makes
this the most convenient way of using `cherokee-admin`.

This tools is intended for local use, and is the natural action to
associate with a launch icon to conviniently deploy `cherokee-admin`
from within any desktop environment. Since this is the intended use,
it will automatically provide the one-time login details to the web
browser, removing the need to copy and paste the user and password. Of
course this step is not necessary when invoked with the
`--unsecure` parameter, but this is not recommended except for
development purposes.

Refer to the link:other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin
documentation ]for more in-depth explanations of all the parameters
and options.
