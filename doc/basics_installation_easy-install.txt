Easy installation
-----------------
The easiest way to install Cherokee is by using the script provided
for easy installations. It compiles and installs the latest version of
the server with a single command:

----
curl http://www.cherokee-project.com/install | python
----

or

----
wget -O - http://www.cherokee-project.com/install | python
----

The easy installation script is the express way to make a Cherokee
installation as seamless and hassle-free as possible.  It will build
and install everything under `/opt/cherokee`, and by deleting that
directory you could totally purge Cherokee from your system.

If you require further customization, this script is not for you. The
other -more elaborate- link:basics_installation.html[installation
methods] will fulfill your needs. Particularly when there is a
prepackaged version of Cherokee available for your architecture you
should follow that route. That will provide you with automatic bootup
scripts, consistency and dependency checks, and an easy upgrade path
tailored to your system whenever a new package is available.
