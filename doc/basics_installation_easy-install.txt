Easy installation
-----------------
The easiest way to install Cherokee is by using the script provided
for easy installations. It compiles and installs the latest version of
the server with a single command:

----
curl http://www.cherokee-project.com/install | python
----

or

----
wget -O - http://www.cherokee-project.com/install | python
----

The other installation methods listed in the
link:basics_installation.html[installation section] are also
recommended, particularly if there is a prepackaged version of
Cherokee available for your architecture. Those will provide you with
automatic bootup scripts, consistency and dependency checks, and an
easy upgrade path tailored to your system whenever a new package is
available.
